`A Node-MCU based device that monitors user's health parameters such as body temperature, blood pressure and blood oxygen % (SpO2) and shares them on the user's smart-phone in realtime.
Built in my Second year as part of academic mini-project.`

- [x] `An ultrasonic sensor detects an approaching person and signals the controller which turns the servo motor attached to the door and also wakes up the monitoring system.`
- [x] `The Max30100 and lm35 sensors measure the pulse-rate, blood oxygen level and body temperature of the person.`
- [x] `The data can be viewed on the person's smartphone when connected to the same Wi-Fi`
